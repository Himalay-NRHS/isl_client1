# ISL Converter - 3D Model Integration

## Overview
This ISL (Indian Sign Language) Converter app now includes 3D model animation support using Three.js. The app can convert text input into a sequence of 3D animated sign language models.

## Features

### 1. Text to Sign Conversion
- **Input**: User types text in the textarea (e.g., "cat child sorry")
- **Processing**: Text is split into individual words
- **Output**: Each word is mapped to its corresponding 3D GLB model
- **Animation**: Models play sequentially with smooth transitions

### 2. 3D Model Integration
- **Technology**: Pure Three.js (no additional React libraries)
- **Models**: GLB format stored in `/public/models/`
- **Animation**: Each model plays its built-in animation once
- **Sequence**: Models play one after another with 500ms delays

### 3. Available Models
Based on the models in your `public/models/` folder:
- Basic words: cat, child, sorry, good, father, student
- Family: father, child, student
- Animals: cat, dog, birds
- Actions: go, collect, share, score
- Descriptors: good, hard, hot, old
- And many more...

## How It Works

### 1. User Interaction
```typescript
// User types text like "cat child sorry"
const inputText = "cat child sorry";

// System splits into words
const words = inputText.split(' '); // ["cat", "child", "sorry"]

// Maps to model paths
const modelPaths = words.map(word => `/models/${word}.glb`);
```

### 2. 3D Rendering Process
```typescript
// Load GLB model using Three.js GLTFLoader
const loader = new GLTFLoader();
const gltf = await loader.loadAsync(modelPath);

// Add to scene
const model = gltf.scene;
scene.add(model);

// Play animation if available
if (gltf.animations.length > 0) {
  const mixer = new AnimationMixer(model);
  const action = mixer.clipAction(gltf.animations[0]);
  action.setLoop(LoopOnce, 1);
  action.play();
}
```

### 3. Sequential Animation
- Each model loads and plays its animation
- When animation completes, moves to next model
- Provides visual feedback during loading
- Handles errors gracefully if model not found

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. Navigate to "Text to Sign" mode
2. Type your message in the text area
3. Click "Try Demo" for sample text or "Convert to Signs"
4. Watch the 3D models animate in sequence
5. Models will automatically play one after another

### For Developers
1. **Adding New Models**: Place `.glb` files in `/public/models/`
2. **Naming Convention**: Model filename should match the word (e.g., `hello.glb` for "hello")
3. **Backend Integration**: Replace the demo code in `handleConvert()` with actual API calls
4. **Customization**: Modify animation timing, camera angles, lighting in `GLBViewer.tsx`

## Demo Features
- **Try Demo**: Loads "cat child sorry" sequence
- **Another Demo**: Loads "good father student" sequence
- **Play Signs**: Manual replay of current sequence
- **Loading States**: Shows spinner during model loading
- **Error Handling**: Displays errors if models fail to load

## Technical Architecture

### Components
- `GLBViewer.tsx`: Core 3D rendering component
- `ConverterView.tsx`: Main UI with text input and mode switching
- `TextToSignMode`: Specific mode for text-to-sign conversion

### Key Features
- **Pure Three.js**: No additional React-Three libraries
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Supports theme switching
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during operations
- **Error Recovery**: Continues sequence even if individual models fail

### File Structure
```
src/
  components/
    GLBViewer.tsx     # 3D model viewer and animator
    ConverterView.tsx # Main converter interface
    ...
public/
  models/            # GLB model files
    cat.glb
    child.glb
    sorry.glb
    ...
```

## Next Steps
1. **Backend Integration**: Connect to actual sign language processing API
2. **Model Optimization**: Optimize GLB files for faster loading
3. **Animation Enhancement**: Add more sophisticated animation transitions
4. **Voice Integration**: Add text-to-speech capabilities
5. **Model Preloading**: Implement model preloading for better performance

## Performance Notes
- Models are loaded on-demand for memory efficiency
- Previous models are removed from scene to prevent memory leaks
- Animation mixers are properly disposed of
- Loading states provide user feedback during model loading

This implementation provides a solid foundation for 3D sign language animation that can be easily extended and integrated with backend services.
